# Analysis Results Overview


&nbsp;

Juventus: 

 - On a game-to-game basis, it appears during the 2017/18 season the stock value of juventus did differ according to results (where Win vs Draw and Draw Vs Loss differed). This was less the case in the 2017/18 season. Overally, this may be explained by a more tumultuous season in 2017/18 with a fluctuating table position, as opposed to a consistent first place position in 2018/19. A lack of difference in the Win vs Loss test though is not in line with this explanation. 
 - Next-working-day results showed only a difference for the Win vs Draw test in the 2017/18 season, and the Win Vs Loss in all competitions in 2018/19. A potential factor may be that domestic losses were very sparse in 2018/19 and so losses in the champions league, which were more punitive, may have skewed the grouping. This is supported by a difference in UCL results compared to all results, and compared to domestic results.
 - Most likely, there is a very small difference in results in the 2017/18 season overall between games, with small positive impacts for wins and negative for losses and draws. Here, it is likely small data groups are lowering the power of the tests used. 
 - Results do not seem to make a difference in the 2018/19 season. 
 -  Judging using generated graphs, it appears that champions league results may impact stock differences in the later knockout rounds. This can only be judged by graphing as there is only enough data for combined seasons Wins vs Loss data in all stages of the champions league, which shows no discernible difference.
 

Roma:

 - Win vs loss tests showed differences in 2017/18 in game-to-game and next-working-day groupings in all competitions. This was not the case for Draw vs loss, and in 2017/18 was not the case in win vs draw. Likely results had some impact on investor confidence in this period. No significant differences were seen in domestic competitions, which perhaps indicates the champions league results were the main factor behind this.
 - However, there are no differences noted between the champions league and other competitions. This may be a case where only a few champions league results in the later do have a significant impact on stock price, and are enough to impact a test across all competitions as this is a larger data pool where a test has more accuracy. 
 - Overall it seems that results probably did not have much, if all, of an effect on stock valuation across the season

Lazio:

 - Win vs Loss groups are almost universally different (the one exception being domestic competitions in 2018/19)
 - Win vs draw different across next-working-day groups though not for game-to-game. Perhaps more data here would change this, and the groups are too close to separate with this small dataset
 - Draw vs loss seems to be the same across competition groupings (Students T-Test in 17/18 would contradict this, though Kruskal for the same dataset would support it)
 - No difference can be seen between competitions
 - This club has the strongest evidence for an impact of results on stock price. It seems in most cases, a win and a loss will produce differentiable stock value changes over game-to-game and next-working-day timescales.
